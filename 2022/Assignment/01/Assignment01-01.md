# A01-01 Prime Number Optimization

Write a program to find the first 1 million prime numbers using
array for optimization. By approving of prime number, the given
number must be operate with the **modulo** function to all **prime number**
from 2 to its square root. If all operants result 0, then the given
number is a prime number. To optimize this operation, the first 20
prime numbers will be stored in array and used as modulus operant.
