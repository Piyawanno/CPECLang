# Variable Size

This exercise shows basic types of **numerical** variable and their size.

In C Language, a variable must be **declared** before assigned and used.
By declaring variables, type of variable must be given. Why?
Be patient and you will see later. For someone, who is impatient,
the keywords are : value scope, memory size, function stack.
For each type of variable, size of memory is required. In this exercise,
you will find out, which size of memory is required for each type of
numerical variable.

## Compile & Run

For Linux & GCC user just run command :

```bash
gcc VariableSize.c -o VariableSize
./VariableSize
```
